# Team-profile-generator

A Node JS app to help you keep track of your team!

## Description

-The main goal for this project was to create website where you can enter information about your team in node.js and have it show up dynamically in an html file.
 
-Using the prompts in node.js you can add team members in the category of manager, engineer and intern.

-Each role has its own attribute that you can add and keep track of on the website. 
 
-The site is also fully tested with Jest.
